# Agent Strategies

This section collects external playbooks and patterns that help agents work with Dagify graphs. The tracked files describe how to integrate a source; the heavy source content lives in ignored folders to keep the repo lean.

- `neon-notes.md`: how to pull in the Neon Notes knowledge base and where to park it locally.
- `neon-notes/` (ignored): optional local clone of the Neon Notes repo for deeper reference.
- `neon-notes-directive.md`: distilled guardrails for agents working in Dagify, based on the Neon Notes directive.

## Using This Section

- Keep summaries, pointers, and conventions in the tracked markdown files.
- Clone or sync external repos into the matching ignored folder when you need the full context.
- When sharing handoffs, include the graph shape, dependency shapes, and any strategy-specific flags (fail-fast, backpressure, effect boundaries).
