# Test Case: Handling Singular Dependencies in `setDependencies`

## Description
This test ensures that attempting to add a singular function dependency using `addDependency()` results in an error, while using `setDependencies()` correctly updates the dependency for a computed node.

## Steps
1. **Create a Computed Node**  
   A computed node is initialized using `createNode((x) => x + 1, () => 5)`. This sets up a function that increments its dependency value by 1, initially dependent on `() => 5`.

2. **Attempt to Add a Singular Function Dependency Using `addDependency()`**
    - The test attempts to add a function dependency using `computed.addDependency(() => 3)`.
    - This should throw an error because `addDependency()` expects dependencies to be either an array or an object, not a singular function.

3. **Use `setDependencies()` with a Singular Function Dependency**
    - `computed.setDependencies(() => 3);` is called to set the dependency correctly.
    - Unlike `addDependency()`, `setDependencies()` replaces all dependencies and supports singular function dependencies.

4. **Await Update Propagation**
    - `await sleep();` ensures the update has time to propagate before checking the result.

5. **Verify Computed Value**
    - Since the new dependency function `() => 3` returns `3`, the computed function `(x) => x + 1` should return `4`.
    - The final assertion `t.is(computed.value, 4);` confirms that the update was applied correctly.

## Code Example
```js
test("Add dependency if dependency is singular should error use setDependencies for singular", async t => {
    const computed = createNode((x) => x + 1, () => 5);
    t.exception(() => computed.addDependency(() => 3));
    computed.setDependencies(() => 3);
    await sleep();
    t.is(computed.value, 4);
});
```

## Expected Behavior
- **Error when using `addDependency()` with a singular function** because `addDependency()` expects an array or object.
- **Successful dependency update with `setDependencies()`** allowing a single function to be assigned.
- **Computed value updates correctly after dependency change.**

## Conclusion
This test verifies that `setDependencies()` is the correct method for setting a singular function as a dependency. It also ensures that `addDependency()` enforces its expected input format, preventing incorrect usage.
